# FaceTrack

FaceTrack is a web-based attendance management system designed to digitally record student attendance using facial verification
The system replaces traditional roll-call and manual attendance methods by using a live webcam-based face capture mechanism

Each student’s facial data is stored securely in a database and later used to verify identity during attendance. The system automatically records attendance along with date, session, and time, ensuring accuracy and transparency.FaceTrack provides a simple interface for registration, attendance marking, and report viewing, making it suitable for classroom environments

The proposed solution implements a facial - based attendance system that automatically verifies student identity using live webcam input. 

By combining face recognition with a web-based platform, the system ensures that attendance is recorded only for physically present students. This solution minimizes manual effort, improves accuracy, and provides a reliable method for managing classroom attendance.
